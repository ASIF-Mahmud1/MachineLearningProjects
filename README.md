This note consist of  keywords and definitions that are commonly used in AI community

### **[Thought Vector](https://wiki.pathmind.com/thought-vectors)** 
A thought vector is like a  [_word vector_](http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec.html#embed), which is typically a vector of 300-500 numbers that represent a word.  A word vector represents a wordâ€™s meaning as it relates to other words (its context) with a single column of numbers.
### **[Inference](https://hazelcast.com/glossary/machine-learning-inference/)** 
Inference refers to the process of using a trained machine learning algorithm to make a prediction. IoT data can be used as the input to a trained machine learning model, enabling predictions that can guide decision logic on the device, at the edge gateway or elsewhere in the IoT system

### **[GRU](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/33283/gated-recurrent-unit-gru)** 
A gated recurrent unit (GRU) is part of a specific model of recurrent neural network that intends to use connections through a sequence of nodes to perform machine learning tasks associated with memory and clustering, for instance, in speech recognition. Gated recurrent units help to adjust neural network input weights to solve the vanishing gradient problem that is a common issue with recurrent neural networks.
